A few things keep me busy these days:

## Kids

- Raising 2 young kids and spending 12 hours a day with them when their school is closed

## Research 

::: {.callout-tip}

## Big picture question

How can we achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century to address climate change?   
How to make the clean energy transition more:

- Sustainable (energy and environment)
- Resilient (energy and climate) 
- Equitable (energy and justice) 

:::

- I'm working with Baruch colleagues on the SSA project Exploring Energy Burden Among the Older Adults and People with Disabilities in New York City Public Housing Communities  
- I'm working with EDF on the Multi-Country Electricity Transition Potential and Challenges Project   
- I'm working on the climate, air pollution, and human health effect of imported solar PV supported by the ClimateWorks Foundation  
- I'm collaborating with LBL on power system decarbonization: we are organizing an [Special Issue](/posts/2024-01-special-issue-china-power-system-carbon-neutrality/index.qmd) (*The Electricity Journal*) and a [Workshop](https://deeppolicylab.github.io/events/2024-07-19-workshop-on-open-modeling-carbon-neutrality-of-the-power-sector/index.html)  


### Welcome collaborations on

- Clean energy global supply chain
- Power system decarbonization modeling
- Climate impact on energy systems
- Just energy transition
- Energy-water-carbon nexus  
- Other interdisciplinary aspects of carbon neutrality
